========

This project is for a journal-type application for web and mobile devices. 

NOTE:
I did not include the "for" loop that is supposed to loop through the keys and posts on this assignment. I had a seperate test document that I was using to try and display the local storage correctly, but nothing was working. If id DID manage to loop through the local storage, it parsed the "key" numbers as single letters in the object instead of looking for the object ids. Either that, or i would get an unexpected encounter of "S" which I didn't really understand.

Currently, all posts will overwrite your previous post.
